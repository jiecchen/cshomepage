== mcTextDiff
[https://github.com/MathCraft/MathCraftAddOn/blob/master/MathCraftAddOn/MathCraftAddOn/Text.m This] package can be used to *diff* two text files in /Mathematica/\R. An example can be found [figures/diff.gif here].

== StreamLib
I am trying to implement a collection of streaming algorithms in pure python, with minimal dependency. The original version is not well-designed, need to redesign the interface. Check [https://github.com/jiecchen/StreamLib github].
